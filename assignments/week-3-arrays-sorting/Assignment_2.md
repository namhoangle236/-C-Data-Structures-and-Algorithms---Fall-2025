## Part A: Chose Tic Tac Toe for this project, 3x3, detail on how to play is in README.md. 2D array is used to draw the board with number from 1-9, then print out in boardgame format.

## Part B: Implemented quicksort, All to upper case and delete spaces for normalization rules, 2D index is a nested index that store A-Z for index 0 to 25, with each having the same A-Z (for 2nd letter of the book). and Big-O of lookup should be O(1), since we're accessing index inside index to list out matches. Big-O of quick sort on average is $O(n \log n)$ based on [big-o.io](https://big-o.io/algorithms/comparison/quicksort/) analysis
